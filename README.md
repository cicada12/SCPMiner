## Project Overview

This tool is designed to generate subgraph coverage patterns from chemical compounds to aid in drug discovery. By analyzing subgraphs within the chemical compound structures, the tool helps identify key patterns and features that are crucial for drug development. These patterns can be leveraged to predict the properties of compounds and assist researchers in discovering new potential drugs.
